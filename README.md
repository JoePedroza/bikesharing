## Overview of the Analysis
Using tools available through Tableau, we are able to analyze and plot certain questions through visualizations.  This challenge is to create a set of visualizations to determine if it is feasible to open a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.  Through analysis of data, we are to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.  Also to show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.  Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
